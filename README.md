NLSA: Non-Local Sparse Attention for Image Super-Resolution
This repository is an open-source reimplementation of the super-resolution method presented in the paper "Non-Local Sparse Attention for Image Super-Resolution" (NLSA). Our implementation closely follows the methodology described in the paper, which introduces a novel attention mechanism that captures long-range dependencies with a sparse attention model to enhance the quality of upscaled images significantly.
